# A simple Authentication | Authorization module using React, Node and Firebase

## Description
Hello, This Project is on a Simple Authenticaiton | Authorization Module in which
I used React JS, Node Js, Express Js, Firebase for Email/Password Authentication
and also Social Apps Authentications like Google, Facebook etc...

I used  
-React Js for Frontend Work including Bootstrap library for styling elements.
-Node Js and Express Js for Backend Work such as 
Routing Pages, 
Authentication Token generation using JsonWebToken,
Use Middlewares to Protect Routes from Unauthorized Access.
-Axios library to call Api's from Backend
-Firebase to store User's Information and Authentication

## Challenges
In this Project, It is still in development because Apple Api is not working Right Now,
For Apple Authentication, We need IOS Platform so it will done in future.

## How to install and run project

Project is split in two parts : frontend and server
in frontend i wrote all codes for frontend and in server the code is for backend
