# A simple Authentication | Authorization module using React, Node and Firebase

## Description
Hello, This Project is on a **Simple Authenticaiton | Authorization Module** in which
I used *React JS*, *Node Js*, *Express Js*, *Firebase* for Email/Password Authentication
and also Social Apps Authentications like Google, Facebook etc...

I used  
1. React Js for Frontend Work including Bootstrap library for styling elements.
2. Node Js and Express Js for Backend Work such as 
    
    - Routing Pages, 
    
    - Authentication Token generation using JsonWebToken,
    
    - Use Middlewares to Protect Routes from Unauthorized Access.
    
3. Axios library to call Api's from Backend
4. Firebase to store User's Information and Authentication

## Challenges
In this Project, It is still in development because Apple Api is not working Right Now,
For Apple Authentication, We need IOS Platform so it will done in future.

## How to install and run project

Project is split in Two parts : **Frontend & Server**

In Frontend I wrote all codes for Frontend and in Server the code is for Backend,

Step 1 : Firstly Clone the git repository in your Computer / Laptop
    
    git clone https://github.com/yashChouriya/react-node-firebase-auth/

Now Files are downloaded in your Device

Now open Two Terminals : One for Frontend and Second for Backend

Step 2 : On first Terminal go to either folder and run command 
    
    npm start

Step 3 : on second terminal go to another folder and run command 
    
    npm start

Step 4 : Both will run on different Ports and now you can Access or Visit the Webpage on 
    
    http://localhost:3000/


## Usage 
In SignUp page you can create Account which is based on Email Verification or
If you have already an Account then you can go to SignIn page and enter the details to SignIn
and also Social SignIn is available below of the both for Social Authentication.

## Credits

I read various Docs from Firebase, Auth API's through ChatGPT and use it in Project.
